# SRXSIM

This radio simulator oriented for virtual reality meetings is fully described in the paper: 
[Performance Modelling and Assessment for Social VR Conference Applications in 5G Radio Networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9606263)
by Jo√£o Morais, Sjors Braam, Remco Litjens, Sandra Kizhakkekundil and Hans van Den Berg.

It uses the [Quadriga](https://quadriga-channel-model.de/) stochastic channel model to simulate the wireless channels in a meeting room where XR meetings happen. Then, one can configure almost 100 parameters to evaluate their impact on the packet drop rate during VR meetings. These parameters span 3 layers: the physical layer (e.g., number of antennas), the MAC layer (e.g., scheduler and beam management parameters), and the application layer (e.g., frame and video compression parameters). 

## Dependencies

1. Windows (for the parallelization tool)
2. Python Libraries:
    * numpy
    * scipy
    * joblib     (          for generation) 
    * matplotlib (          for data analysis)
    * moviepy    (optional, for data analysis. To install do: conda install -c conda-forge moviepy) 
    * PyPDF2     (optional, for data analysis. To install do: conda install -c conda-forge pypdf2) 

3. Matlab Runtime Compiler 9.8 (for Matlab 2020a)


## Suggested Development Environment

[Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/), installed through Anaconda.

For installing:
1. Install anaconda
2. Open anaconda prompt
3. Update anaconda: conda update conda
4. Search the most recent version of spyder: conda search -f spyder
5. Install that version (say 5.0.5 is currently the most recent): conda install spyder=5.0.5 

For updating to a new version of Spyder, repeat steps 2 to 5.
